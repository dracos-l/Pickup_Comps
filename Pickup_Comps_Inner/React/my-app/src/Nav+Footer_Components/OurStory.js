        We're both high school seniors from Horace Mann School, going to Duke(Logan) and UChicago(Ethan) class of 2026.
        We started taking CS sophmore year and are currently taking AP Comp Sci together. Ethan will
        be majoring in Data Science and Logan will be majoring in Computer Science. <br /> <br />
        Our project started when we had to complete a final project for the second semester of our
        AP Compsci class. Since we're both big fans of basketball and love playing pickup, we took
        inspiration from this site: <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13scl9iazY4LPh1ir3EUtfEJkDL09epzX8R11_VYurUM/edit#gid=1932561844'>
        Pickup Basketball Comps</a> but we wanted to use NBA.com's data to make it more precise and accurate. <br /> <br />
        We hope you enjoy the site, and definitely reccomend it to your friends! It gets a lot more fun when
        friends fill it out for you and you end up getting Hamidou Diallo.
